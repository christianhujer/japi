            This package contains several utility classes for making GUI programming with Swing less painful.
            The most notable classes are:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>{@link net.sf.japi.swing.ActionBuilder}</dt>
            <dd>
                This class creates {@link javax.swing.Action} objects which call their final methods using {@link java.lang.reflect Reflection}, are localized using {@link java.util.ResourceBundle}s and user configurable using {@link java.util.prefs Preferences}.
            </dd>
            <dt>{@link net.sf.japi.swing.ToolBarLayout}</dt>
            <dd>
                If you use {@link javax.swing.JToolBar}, this is the layout you were always looking for.
            </dd>
            <dt>{@link net.sf.japi.progs.jeduca.swing.InternalFrameManager}, {@link net.sf.japi.progs.jeduca.swing.MenuManager}, {@link net.sf.japi.progs.jeduca.swing.ToolBarManager}</dt>
            <dd>
                If you want to give your users the power to modify the application appearance by moving, hiding, showing toolbars, menus etc., use
                these.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            A final note: Not all classes thats names end on "Manager" are derived from AbstractManager.
            Have a look at the Tree instead of making that assumption.
            For that reason, probably some of the class names will change in future.
        </p>
