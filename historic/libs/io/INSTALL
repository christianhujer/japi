BUILDING / INSTALLING JAPI LIB IO
---------------------------------


Japi Lib IO is a library for Java developers.  Because of that, installation
is not applicable.  The rest of the file is concerned with building it only.

To build Japi Lib IO, you need Java 5.0 and Ant 1.6.5.  The applications you
build using Japi Lib net will need Java 5.0 or newer and of course Japi
Lib Net.


To build Japi Lib IO, just run ant in the project's root directory or
specifying the build.xml in the project's root directory.  To find out, what
other options you have for building Japi Lib IO, try "ant -projecthelp".


Usually, you'd just want to use Japi Lib IO in your favorite IDE and include
all those Japi Lib IO classes that you used directly or indirectly in your
build.  To do so, the easiest way usually is this:
1. Create a .jar file with the Japi Lib IO classes by running "ant dist".
2. Include that .jar file in the classpath of your IDE.
