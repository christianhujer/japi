BUILDING / INSTALLING JAPI TAGLETS
----------------------------------


Japi Taglets is a javadoc taglet library for Java developers.  Because of that,
installation is not applicable.  The rest of the file is concerned with
building it only.

To build Japi Taglets, you need Java 5.0 and Ant 1.6.5.  The applications you
build using Japi Taglets will need Java 5.0 or newer and of course Japi
Taglets.


To build Japi Taglets, just run ant in the project's root directory or
specifying the build.xml in the project's root directory.  To find out, what
other options you have for building Japi Taglets, try "ant -projecthelp".


Usually, you'd just want to use Japi Taglets in your favorite IDE and include
all those Japi Taglets classes that you used directly or indirectly in your
build.  To do so, the easiest way usually is this:
1. Create a .jar file with the Japi Taglets classes by running "ant dist".
2. Include that .jar file in the classpath of your IDE.
