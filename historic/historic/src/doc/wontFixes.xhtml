        <title>JAPI Won't Fix List</title>

        <p>
            JAPI is not perfect. JAPI has some flaws. This page lists these known flaws along with reasons why they won't be fixed.

                That's not a flaw but a feature.
                Writing non-free or non-open source programs that merely use JAPI is okay as long as you do not make changes to JAPI sources.

            <dt>XML support for property files</dt>
            <dd>
                That's not a flaw in JAPI but a flaw in java.util.ResourceBundle, which only uses the properties capabilities, but not the XML
                capabilities of the java.util.Properties class.
                If you want this improved, talk to SUN or provide us with a patch.
                Anyway, the resource bundle handling is a bit broken because it is hard to provide factories for other resource bundle storages without
                "patching" the original Java.
