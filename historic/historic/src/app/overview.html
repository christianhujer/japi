        <h1>JAPI Overview</h1>
        <p>
            JAPI is a Java API that extends the original API with features that the JAPI developers found to be missing or with classes that proxy or
            facade the original Java API to make it easier to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, JAPI consists of the following fields of classes:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>IO</dt>
            <dt>Generic Swing</dt>
            <dd>
                The classes in {@link net.sf.japi.swing} extend Swing with new features like components for certain features (e.g. TipOfTheDay, FileField, JFileChooserButton, ProgressDisplay, XML Parser error (e.g. invalid XML) display), managers for groups of features (ActionBuilder, IconManager, LookAndFeelManager), renderers (LocaleListCellRenderer) and handy Action implementations (DisposeAction, DummyAction, ReflectionAction, ToggleAction).
            </dd>
            <dt>Swing Preferences</dt>
            <dd>
                The package {@link net.sf.japi.swing.prefs} contains a framework for creating preferences dialogs with Swing.
            </dd>
            <dt>Utility classes</dt>
            <dd>
                Some utility classes like some useful iterators, a Util class providing features you might miss in {@link java.util.Collections} or {@link java.util.Arrays} and some new Collection classes.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </body>
