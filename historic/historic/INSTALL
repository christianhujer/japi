BUILDING / INSTALLING JAPI
--------------------------


JAPI is a library for Java developers.  Because of that, installation is not
applicable.  The rest of the file is concerned with building JAPI only.

To build JAPI, you need Java 5.0 and Ant 1.6.5.  The applications you build
using JAPI will need Java 5.0 or newer.


To build JAPI, just run ant in the project's root directory or specifying the
build.xml in the project's root directory.  To find out, what other options
you have for building JAPI, try "ant -projecthelp".


Usually, you'd just want to use JAPI in your favorite IDE and include all
those JAPI classes that you used directly or indirectly in your build.  To do
so, the easiest way usually is this:
1. Create a .jar file with the JAPI classes by running "ant distLib".
2. Include that .jar file in the classpath of your IDE.
3. When building your application distribution archive with Ant, add JAPI's
   src/app directory to the sourcepath (not srcdir) of your javac task.
   Plain javac usage is analogous.
