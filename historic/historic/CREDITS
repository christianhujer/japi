JAPI wouldn't exist without the following projects:

* KEduca, which is part of the KDE EDU package and inspired of writing a clone of it in Java, which much of JAPI was derived from.
* Daimonin, an MMORPG, that has a Map Editor written in Java which became JAPI's second application and made JAPI much more mature.
