PROJECT DESCRIPTION

JAPI is a library for Java developers.  Its intention is to make the creation
of internationalized swing applications easier.  Additionally it contains
several classes that its inventors think could be useful for other developers.


PROJECT WEBSITE

Project homepage: http://japi.sourceforge.net/
Project website:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/japi/


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Java 5.0
    Previous versions of Java will not work.  JAPI uses Generics, autoboxing,
    static imports, foreach loops, assertions and varargs quite a lot.

Ant 1.6.5
    Previous versions of Ant might work but are not tested.


FILE STRUCTURE

.cvsignore
    Hidden file to keep generated files that reside outside dest/ and are not
    part of the cvs repository out of cvs screen messages.

build.xml
    The build file to build the project with Ant.

COPYING
    JAPI license conditions.  Note: applies to JAPI only, not third party
    libraries.

CREDITS

dest/
    The directory containing generated files.

developer.proprties
    Optional file for changing default settings of the Ant build.  You won't

    override properties for build.xml, this is the place to put them.

dist/
    Generated directory containing distribution archives.

lib/
    Directory containing third part libraries used to build JAPI.  Please note
    that these third party libraries have their own license conditions.  The
    licenses of the third party libraries are included in the lib/ directory.

progs/
    Small JAPI-based programs that are yet too small to be worth a project of
    their own.

src/app/
    Core JAPI library sources.
