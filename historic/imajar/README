JAPI ImaJar is a set of shell scripts for easy installation of executable Jars
for command line usage.

ImaJar means "I'm a jar", which is the basic philosophy.  The Jar should know
itself that it is a jar, not the user.  The user shouldn't notice a difference
whether the command she executes is a normal exe or a jar.

ImaJar mainly consists of three simply bash shells scripts:

install.sh
    This script installs ImaJar for the user that runs the script.

insjar.sh
    This script takes two arguments.
    The first argument is the jar file that shall be available as command.
    The second argument is the desired command name.
    Running the script will install the jar and make it available under the
    given command name.

imajar.sh
    This script is used to mimic normal commands with jars.


How does ImaJar work behind the scene?

insjar.sh copies the Jar file to a special directory.
Then it creates two links: One for the jar and one for the command.
The link for the command links to imajar.sh from the desired command name.
The link for the jar is, apart from the ending, the same name as the link to
the command.

Example:
insjar.sh Replacer-0.1-app.jar Replacer
Result:
~/bin/Replacer links to ~/bin/imajar.sh
~/bin/jars/Replacer.jar links to ~/bin/jars/Replacer-0.1-app.jar
running "Replacer" will execute ~/bin/jars/Repalcer-0.1-app.jar
